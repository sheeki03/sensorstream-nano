# Compute Units Used
~40,000 CU 

# Implementation Details
Replay protection via timestamp validation: require!(timestamp > buffer.last_timestamp)

Input validation: value bounds (â‰¤10000), timestamp bounds (>0, <i64::MAX-86400)

Buffer overflow protection: checked arithmetic with explicit bounds

# Security Features
Timestamp DoS protection: rejects values near i64::MAX

Value bounds validation: prevents invalid sensor readings

Buffer index safety: overflow-safe arithmetic with modulo

Account isolation: each bot writes only to its own PDA

Rent exemption: enforced to prevent account closure attacks

# Test Coverage
11 tests covering security edge cases, input validation, buffer safety, concurrency, and attack vectors
