# Compute Units Used
~75,000 CU

# Implementation Details
New last_timestamp field added to the buffer for fast replay validation

Original interface unchanged: submit_reading(value: u16, timestamp: i64)

Memory impact: 8 additional bytes (total size: 89 bytes vs. 81 before)

Validation: require!(timestamp > buffer.last_timestamp)

# Security & Concurrency
Access Control: Each bot can only write to its own PDA

Replay Protection: Enforced strictly by timestamp ordering

Concurrency: No conflicts as each bot writes to its unique PDA

# Performance
Storage: 89 bytes per account (about $0.0006 in rent)

Compute: ~75,000 CU, mainly due to fast direct field access

Efficiency: O(1) validation with minimal overhead

# Future Improvements
Some optimizations remain:

Pack idx and last_timestamp together to save space

Switch from i64 to u64 for timestamps

Apply micro optimizations to shave off additional compute units
